"A Python for beginners course is a programming course designed to introduce people with little or no programming experience to the Python programming language. The course typically starts with an overview of the basics of programming concepts such as data types, variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming.

The course will also cover the fundamental features of the Python programming language such as data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples), input/output operations, and modules. Students will learn how to write basic Python programs, debug code, and create simple Python projects.

The course will likely include hands-on exercises, quizzes, and assignments to reinforce learning. At the end of the course, students should have a solid foundation in Python programming and be able to write simple programs and scripts on their own.",0,python for beginners
"A mid-level Python course is designed for individuals who have some prior experience with programming in Python and want to take their skills to the next level. This course will cover more advanced concepts and techniques that build upon the fundamental skills learned in a beginner-level course.

The course will begin with a review of basic Python syntax, data structures, and control structures. From there, students will learn about more advanced topics such as object-oriented programming, decorators, generators, and closures. They will also explore more complex data structures such as sets, dictionaries, and tuples, and learn how to work with them effectively.

The course will cover various programming paradigms, including functional programming and imperative programming, and how to use them to solve real-world problems. Students will also learn how to write modular and reusable code using modules, packages, and libraries.

The course will conclude with an introduction to web development using Python, including how to use popular frameworks like Flask and Django to build web applications.",1,python mid level
"A Django course is designed to teach you how to use the Django framework, which is a popular web framework for building web applications with Python.
